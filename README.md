### A collection of BASIC PISS AND SHIT i need to make Python programs

You want a good, unbloated, performant Python script? Well then be ready to write a lot of libraries. This is what this repository is about, **BASIC PISS AND SHIT** I usually require but cannot find in an unbloated/unlicensed form. Is this a framework?.. a library?.. No, this is just **PISS AND SHIT**.
